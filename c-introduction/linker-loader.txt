A linker takes one or more object files generated by the compiler and combines them into a 
single executable file. 

It resolves references between different code files and links in 
external libraries.

A loader, on the other hand, is part of the operating system that loads the executable into 
memory and prepares it to run, setting up memory, stack, and program counters.

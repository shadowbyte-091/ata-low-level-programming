1. Preprocessing: 
   The preprocessor handles things like #include and #define before actual compilation. 
   It expands macros and includes header files into the code.

2. Compiling: 
   The compiler translates the preprocessed C code into assembly code for the target machine.

3. Assembling: 
   The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code (object files, e.g. .o).

4. Linking: 
   The linker combines one or more object files with libraries to produce the final executable program.

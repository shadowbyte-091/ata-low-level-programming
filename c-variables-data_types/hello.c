 * C is still important today because:
 * 1. It is the foundation of many modern programming languages (C++, Java, etc.).
 * 2. It provides direct access to memory and hardware, making it essential for system programming.
 * 3. Operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications rely heavily on C.
 * 4. Learning C builds a strong foundation for understanding how computers actually work.
